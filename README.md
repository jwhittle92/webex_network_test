This script will open Firefox, browse to https://mediatest.ciscospark.com, and run the WebEx Network Test tool. This occurs every 5 minutes. To modify how often this script is run, edit the 'interval' variable with the appropriate amount of time (seconds).

If any of the tests fail (App, Room, or Call tests), the results will be written to a text file and saved.
